### SpotifyPatcher bypasses Spotify's ads and auto-update on Windows.

# About

SpotifyPatcher is a program made by Takaovi (Me). The program was not meant to be published, so expect some buggy code. 

The program (SpotifyPatcher) uses one batch file from [BlockTheSpot](https://github.com/master131/BlockTheSpot) to bypass ads. It uses another batch file to bypass and patch auto-update. The rest of the program is done in C# and it basically stitches everything together. If your anti-virus detects the program as a virus you have nothing to worry about, it's just a false positive.

⚠️ This mod is for the [Desktop release](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/) of Spotify on Windows and not the Microsoft Store version.

# Future of SpotifyPatcher

The whole program will be fully C# with no external files. (Or a few)
* This will most likely take the false positive away.

Hopefully I will find the time to update SpotifyPatcher as Spotify continues to fight back the nonpaid adfree experience. 
* This might require your support too. If you have a thing you'd like to be added or fixed tell me, or even do a pull request!

# Uninstallation

Simply click the "Uninstall Spotify" button, remove the program (SpotifyPatcher) and install Spotify again manually.
