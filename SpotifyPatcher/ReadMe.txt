Welcome, first of all, thanks for using my little patcher!

How to successfully remove ads and keep Spotify from auto-updating?
1. Run SpotifyPatcher.exe, click "Patch all"
|
2. Use the shortcut to start Spotify every time you want to use Spotify. (This is not needed to block ads but if you want your Spotify not to auto-update please use the shortcut.)
| - If you move the shortcut's location, remember to edit the shortcut's "target" and the path on it.
| - You can add the shortcut to the taskbar without changing anything!
|
3. Enjoy!
